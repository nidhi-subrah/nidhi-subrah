## Welcome! 👋

# About Me  

Hi! I’m Nidhi Subrahmanya, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for building intelligent, data-driven systems.  

I recently worked as an **AI & Data Analyst Intern at Gay Lea**, where I automated workflows with Power Automate, deployed AI agents on enterprise data, and improved supply chain visibility through real-time tracking tools. Previously, as a **Web Developer at Electrium Mobility**, I contributed to frontend development using React/Next.js and optimized backend performance with Supabase and PostgreSQL.  

Beyond internships, I’ve developed projects like **TheraMind** (an AI-powered mental health companion), **DermaCare** (a personalized skincare scanner), and **Podcastify** (a textbook-to-podcast converter).

I’m currently seeking **Winter 2026 internships** and would be glad to connect!
